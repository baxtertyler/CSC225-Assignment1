CPE 225
Assignment 1

Name: Tyler Baxter

What you think this class is about?
- I think this class is about how to use terminal to access different parts of the computer. Also, I think we will be learning a lot of different languages and different ways to code.
What you you hope to get from this class?
- I hope to get a better understanding on what terminal can do on the computer, how to code in new languages, and learn about what's going on behind the scene when the code is ran.
What is your biggest concern as a student as Cal Poly.
- My biggest concern as a student at Cal Poly is not understand a core concept that is essential to the classes I take in the future. I do not want to fall behind and not be able to understand what's going on in future classes.
